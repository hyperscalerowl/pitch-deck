# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates apply to the `main` branch. Please base all security-critical work from the latest commit on `main`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. Instead, email the core team at [security@hyperscalerowl.com](mailto:security@hyperscalerowl.com) with the following details:

- A description of the vulnerability and potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept.
- Any suggested remediation or mitigation ideas.

You will receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours. We aim to provide an initial assessment and remediation plan within 7 business days.

## Disclosure Policy

Once a fix has been implemented and released, we will coordinate a disclosure date with you. Public disclosure prior to an agreed-upon date is discouraged.
